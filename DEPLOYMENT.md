# LycanChat Deployment Guide

## The Problem with Static Deployments

Your observation about "Connection lost. Trying to reconnect..." is exactly right! Here's why:

1. **Socket.IO needs a persistent server** - Static sites can't maintain WebSocket connections
2. **No real-time features** - File uploads, live messaging, user notifications all break
3. **Connection errors** - The client keeps trying to connect to a server that doesn't exist

When deployed as static files, LycanChat becomes a broken single-user app with constant connection errors.

## Solutions for Your Deployment Issue

### Quick Fix for Vercel (Static Version)
To stop the "Connection lost" errors and get a working (but limited) version:

1. **In your Vercel dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Set "Output Directory" to `dist/public`
   - Redeploy

2. **This gives you:**
   - ✅ Working chat interface with orange theme
   - ✅ Multi-language support  
   - ✅ Local message storage
   - ❌ No real-time messaging
   - ❌ No file uploads
   - ❌ No user notifications

### Best Solutions for Full Features

#### Option 1: Deploy on Replit (Recommended)
1. Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit
2. Get a permanent URL with all features working
3. Real-time chat, file uploads, multi-language - everything works

#### Option 2: Railway.app 
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys your full app
3. Free tier includes Socket.IO support

#### Option 3: Render.com
1. Connect GitHub repo, choose "Web Service"
2. Build command: `npm run build` 
3. Start command: `npm start`

## Why Static Hosts Don't Work

Services like Netlify, GitHub Pages, and Vercel's static hosting can't run:
- ❌ Socket.IO real-time messaging
- ❌ File upload processing
- ❌ Server-side features

They only serve static HTML/CSS/JS files.

## Current App Status

Your LycanChat works perfectly on Replit with:
- ✅ Real-time messaging with Socket.IO
- ✅ File and image uploads
- ✅ Multi-language support (English, Vietnamese, Russian)
- ✅ Orange Lycanroc-Dusk theme
- ✅ Memory-only storage (no database needed)

**Recommendation**: Use Replit's built-in deployment for the easiest solution!
